This text might be a line in a file (especially a TSV file when a line contains a number of distinct fields), or the entire text of a file that\\u2019s perhaps open in an editor in the enclosing app.\\n\\nThe basic functions return an object containing two lists:\\n\\n1.  successList: a list of strings giving an overview of what checks have been made,\\n2.  noticeList: a list of objects with fields that can be filtered, sorted, combined, and then displayed as error or warning messages.\\n\\nNote that the object may also contain other relevant fields such as `checkedFileCount`, `checkedFilenames`, `checkedFilenameExtensions`, `checkedFilesizes`, `checkedRepoNames`, and `elapsedSeconds`.\\n\\nThere are three sample notice processing functions that show how to:\\n\\n1.  Divide the noticeList into a list of errors and a list of warnings,\\n2.  Divide the noticeList into a list of severe, medium, and low priority warnings,\\n3.  Convert the noticeList into a list of warnings sorted by priority,\\n\\nIn addition, there are Styleguidist pages viewable at \\\\[[https://unfoldingword.github.io/uw-content-validation/]] which show how these core functions may be used, effectively producing a primitive app that checks Door43.org files, repositories (repos), book packages, etc. as well as demonstrating the basic functions.\\n\\n## The Stack\\n\\n-   Javascript for primary functions.\\n-   React (functional components & hooks) for demonstration applets.\\n-   MaterialUI for UI/UX baseline design components.\\n-   Styleguidist for Playground Documentation.\\n-   Yarn for dependencies, publishing, and deploying.\\n-   Github + NPM + Github Pages for Hosting.\\n-   Cypress for testing\\n\\n## Design Philosophy\\n\\nThis code is designed to thoroughly check various types of Bible-related content data files. This includes:\\n\\n1.  [Unified Standard Format Marker](ubsicap.github.io/usfm/) (USFM) Bible content files, including original language Bibles and Bible translations aligned by word/phrase to the original words/phrases\\n2.  Legacy Translation Notes (TN) tables in Tab-Separated Values (9-column TSV) files\\n3.  New tables in Tab-Separated Values (TSV) files (uses TWL, TN2 and TQ2, SN and SQ)\\n4.  Markdown files (and markdown fields in TSV files)\\n5.  Plain-text files\\n6.  Metadata (manifest) YAML files\\n\\nNote: There is also a separate function for checking individual TSV lines (e.g., TN, TN2, TQ2) which is intended to be able to provide immediate user feedback if built into a TSV editor.\\n\\nThe top-level checking demonstrations return:\\n\\n1.  A list of things that were checked (successList)\\n2.  Typically a list of (higher-priority) errors and a list of (lower-priority) warnings, but other formats for display of messages are also demonstrated.\\n\\nNote that it\\'s quite possible for the package to give multiple different notices for a single mistake. For example, a punctuation abnormality in a quoted text might advise about the bad punctuation as well as advising about not being able to match the quote. The package errs on the side that having additional warnings is better than missing a warning (and then later being confused about why a data file won\\'t load). These consequential warnings mean that, if possible, it\\'s good to rerun the checks from time to time on your latest files as you\\'re fixing multiple errors.\\n\\n### Notice Objects (in noticeList)\\n\\nHowever, the lower-level checking functions provide only the list of success message strings and one list of `notices` (i.e., warnings/errors combined) typically consisting of an object with some or all of the following fields (as available/relevant):\\n\\nThere are two compulsory fields in all of these notice objects:\\n\\n1.  `priority`: A notice priority number in the range 1-1000. Each different type of warning/error has a unique number (but not each instance of those warnings/errors). By default, notice priority numbers 700 and over are considered `errors` and 0-699 are considered `warnings`, but in truth, that\\u2019s rather arbitrary.\\n2.  `message`: The actual general descriptive text of the notice\\n\\nAll of the following fields may be missing or undefined, i.e., they\\u2019re all optional:\\n\\n1.  `details`: More helpful details about the notice (if applicable)\\n2.  `repoCode`: brief repository code (if available), e.g., \\'UHB\\', \\'LT\\', \\'ST\\', \\'TN\\', \\'TQ\\', \\'TN2\\', \\'TQ2\\', etc.\\n3.  `repoName`: Door43 repository name (if available), e.g., \\'en_ta\\', \\'hi_tw\\'\\n4.  `filename`: filename string (if available)\\n5.  `bookID`: The 3-character UPPERCASE [book identifier](http://ubsicap.github.io/usfm/identification/books.html) or [OBS](https://www.openbiblestories.org/) (if relevant)\\n6.  `C`: The chapter number or OBS story number (if relevant)\\n7.  `V`: The verse number or OBS frame number (if relevant)\\n8.  `rowID`: 4-character ID field for TSV row (if relevant)\\n9.  `lineNumber`: A one-based line number in the file (if available)\\n10. `fieldName`: name of TSV field (if relevant)\\n11. `characterIndex`: A **zero-based** integer character index which indicates the position of the error in the given text (line or field) (if available)\\n12. `excerpt`: An excerpt (if available) from the checked text which indicates the area containing the problem. Where helpful, some character substitutions have already been made, for example, if the notice is about spaces, it is generally helpful to display spaces as a visible character in an attempt to best highlight the issue to the user. (The length of the excerpt defaults to ten characters, but is settable as an option.)\\n13. `location`: A string indicating the context of the notice, e.g., \"in line 17 of \\'someBook.usfm\\'\". (Still not completely sure what should be left in this string now that we have added optional `repoName`, `filename`, `rowID`, `lineNumber`, `fieldName` fields.)\\n14. `extra`: for a check that looks in multiple repos, this contains extra identifying information (typically the `repoCode`) to help the user determine what resource/repo/file that the notice applies to (which, in the demos, is then often prepended to the `message`).\\n\\nKeeping our notices in this format, rather than the simplicity of just saving an array of single strings, allows the above _notice components_ to be processed at a higher level, e.g., to allow user-controlled filtering, sorting, etc. For example, in a rush it might be good to display the highest priority messages first, and fix a few of those. On the other hand, if working systematically through, it might be good to sort by filename and line-number so that warnings about the same part of a file can be viewed together irrespective of their different priority numbers.\\n\\nThe default in the demos is to funnel all the raw notices through the supplied `processNoticesToErrorsWarnings` function (in demos/notice-processing-functions.fs) which does the following:\\n\\n1.  Removes excess repeated errors. For example, if there\\u2019s a systematic error in a file, say with unneeded leading spaces in every field, rather than returning with hundreds of errors, only the first several errors will be returned, followed by an \"errors suppressed\" message. (The number of each error displayed is settable as an option\\u2014zero means display all errors with no suppression.)\\n2.  Separates notices into error and warning lists based on the priority number. (The switch-over point is settable as an option.)\\n3.  Optionally drops the lowest priority notices and/or certain given notice types (by priority number).\\n\\nThere is a second version of the function which splits into `Severe`, `Medium`, and `Low` priority lists instead. And a third version that leaves them as notices, but allows for a Bright red...Dull red colour gradient instead.\\n\\nHowever, the user is, of course, free to create their own alternative version of these functions. This is possibly also the place to consider localisation of all the notices into different interface languages???\\n\\n## User-settable Options\\n\\n### Checking Options\\n\\nThere is provision for checking to be altered and/or sped-up when the calling app sets some or all of the following fields in `checkingOptions`:\\n\\n-   `disableAllLinkFetchingFlag`: a boolean (true/false) which if set to true, stops the package from fetching and checking links, e.g., when a translation note refers to Translation Academy it won\\u2019t check that the TA article actually exists, and also stops the checking of any extra files like LICENSE.md\\u2014this gives a dramatic speed-up to many checks (but, of course, it means that the data might still contain quite major errors)\\n-   `getFile`: a function which takes the four parameters ({username, repository, path, branch}) and returns the full text of the relevant Door43 file\\u2014default is to use our own function and associated caching\\n-   `fetchRepositoryZipFile`: a function which takes the three parameters ({username, repository, branch}) and returns the contents of the zip file containing all the Door43 files\\u2014default is to use our own function and associated caching\\n-   `getFileListFromZip`: takes the same three parameters and returns a list/array containing the filepaths of all the files in the zip file from Door43\\u2014default is to use our own function and associated caching\\n-   `originalLanguageVerseText`: the Hebrew/Aramaic or Greek original language text for the book/chapter/verse of the TSV line being checked\\u2014this enables `Quote` fields to be checked without needing to load and parse the actual USFM file\\n-   `originalLanguageRepoUsername` and `originalLanguageRepoBranch`: these two fields can be used to specify the username/organisation and/or the branch/tag name for fetching the UHB and UGNT files for checking\\n-   `taRepoUsername`, `taRepoBranchName`: these two fields can be used to specify the username/organisation and/or the branch/tag name for fetching the TA files for checking\\n-   `taRepoLanguageCode`, and `taRepoSectionName`: can be used to specify how the `SupportReference` field is checked in TA\\u2014defaults are \\'en\\' and \\'translate\\'\\n-   `twRepoUsername`, `twRepoBranchName`: these two fields can be used to specify the username/organisation and/or the branch/tag name for fetching the TW files for checking\\n-   `excerptLength`: an integer which defines how long excerpts of lines containing errors should be\\u2014the default is 15 characters\\u2014the package attempts to place the error in the middle of the excerpt\\n-   `cutoffPriorityLevel`: an integer which can define notices to not be detected\\u2014defaults to 0 so none are dropped. Note that this will also affect the `suggestion` response. (Only partially implemented at present, so drops some but not all low priority notices.)\\n-   `suppressNoticeDisablingFlag`: Defaults to `false`, i.e., to removing (thus suppressing) notices for warnings which are expected in certain files and hence we don\\u2019t want them displayed. Note that this is always set to `true` for the demos (because they suppress these notices later\\u2014see the `showDisabledNoticesFlag` below).\\n\\n      Currently this supressing is only done in the (exported) `checkTN_TSV9Table` and `checkNotesTSV7Table` functions which we know to be called by [tC Create](https://github.com/unfoldingWord/tc-create-app) as well as `checkManifestText`, `checkMarkdownText`, `checkPlainText`, `checkTN_TSV9Table`, `checkUSFMText`, and `checkYAMLText` called by the [Content Validation App](https://github.com/unfoldingWord-box3/content-validation-app).\\n\\nMost of the high-level demonstrations allow a choice of one of three display formats for notices:\\n\\n-   \\'SingleList\\': sorts notices by priority (highest first) then colours the highest ones bright red, slowly fading to black for the lowest priorities\\n-   \\'ErrorsWarnings\\': arbitrarily divides notices into a list of _errors_ and a list of _warnings_, each displayed in different colours\\n-   \\'SevereMediumLow\\': divides notices into three lists which are displayed in different colours\\n\\n### Processing Options\\n\\nIn addition, there are some options in the display of notices for the demonstrations, set in `optionalProcessingOptions` used by the sample notice processing functions:\\n\\n-   `ignorePriorityNumberList`: a list (array) of integers that causes of notices with these priority values to be dropped during notice processing\\n-   `sortBy`: a string which can be set to \\'ByPriority\\', \\'ByRepo\\', or \\'AsFound\\'\\u2014the default is \\'ByPriority\\', i.e., unsorted\\n-   `errorPriorityLevel`: an integer which can define _errors_ (vs _warnings_) (if relevant)\\u2014defaults to 700 (and above)\\n-   `severePriorityLevel`: an integer which can define _severe_ errors (if relevant)\\u2014defaults to 800 (and above)\\n-   `mediumPriorityLevel`: an integer which can define _medium_ errors (if relevant)\\u2014defaults to 600 (and up to `severePriorityLevel`)\\n-   `cutoffPriorityLevel` (deprecated): an integer which can define notices to be dropped/ignored\\u2014defaults to 0 so none are dropped\\n-   `maximumSimilarMessages`: an integer which defines how many of a certain notice to display, before summarising and saying something like _99 similar errors suppressed_\\u2014zero means don\\u2019t ever summarise notices\\u2014defaults to 3\\n-   `showDisabledNoticesFlag`: some content files produce false alarms, e.g., a discussion of using the , as punctuation. Where known, these false alarm notices are disabled from being shown. Setting this flag to \\'true\\' would show these notices (with the word \"(disabled)\" added) instead\\u2014the default is \\'false\\'.\\n\\n## Still To Do\\n\\nThere is a list of open issues at \\\\[[https://github.com/unfoldingWord/uw-content-validation/issues]] (and you can add suggestions and bug reports there at any time). But in summary, still unfinished (in rough priority order):\\n\\n1.  Finish checking that new formats working are again (in `newFormat` branches)\\n2.  Finish moving `cutoffPriorityLevel` from `processingOptions` to `checkingOptions`\\n3.  The `suggestion` mechanism is working, but more suggestions need to be created\\n4.  Checking of general markdown and naked links (esp. in plain text and markdown files)\\n5.  Work through all [Issues](https://github.com/unfoldingWord/uw-content-validation/issues)\\n6.  Work through all `ToDo`s in code\\n7.  Standardise parameters according to best practice (i.e., dereferencing, etc.)\\u2014might be too late now???\\n8.  Document the API with (JsDoc)\\n9.  Improve general documentation in the code and readMe files\\n10. Is our `RepoCheck` the same as `ResourceContainerCheck`? Or is the latter more specific?\\n11. Understand and standardise React stuff in the demos, e.g., e.g., withStyles, etc.\\n12. Check for and remove left-over (but unused) code from the source projects that the original code was copied from\\n13. Remove all debug code and console logging, and to consider possible speed and memory optimizations\\n14. Add a Scripture Burrito check (once Door43 has that available).\\n\\nKnown bugs:\\n\\n1.  Not all demos have all available options\\n2.  \\'NEW\\' option not yet working again in Book Package Check\\n3.  Work on checking naked links in text files is not yet completed\\n4.  File caching (i.e., not checking latest file versions) is still a frustration that needs to be investigated\\u2014presumably it\\u2019s out of control of this package and its demos???\\n\\nKnown check deficiencies:\\n\\n1.  Markdown image format `![xx](yy)` is not yet fully checked\\n2.  Manifests are not checked against all files, i.e., to find files potentially missing from the manifest\\n3.  Naked HTTP links are not yet checked properly\\n4.  ULT/UST quotes in TranslationAcademy are not yet checked\\n\\n## Functionality and Limitations\\n\\nSee component `README` for details.\\n\\n# How to install\\n\\nOnce you have this codebase forked and cloned to your local machine, you can start modifying the codebase. You will need to ensure `node.js` and `yarn` are already installed.\\n\\n### Installation and Running the Styleguide Locally\\n\\n1.  Install the npm dependencies with `yarn`.\\n2.  Run the Styleguide with `yarn start`.\\n3.  Ensure that the Styleguide is running by visiting `localhost:6060` on your web browser. (for Chromebooks see note below)\\n4.  Modify the code and documentation in your code editor and check out the Styleguide.\\n    -   Update the styleguide.config.js to match your new component names.\\n5.  See debug `userLog()` output in browser console\\u2014in chrome, CTRL-SHIFT-J to open.\\n\\n### Setting up NPM Publishing\\n\\n1.  Rename your library:\\n    -   the folder\\n    -   repo on Github\\n2.  Update the `package.json`:\\n    -   change the `name` and `description` of your app\\n    -   change the URLs of your `homepage` and `repository`\\n3.  Create an account on `npmjs.org` if you don\\u2019t have one already.\\n\\n### Publishing to NPM\\n\\nThe scripts in the `package.json` file do all of the heavy lifting.\\n\\n1.  Commit and push all changes to your github repo.\\n2.  Run `yarn publish`:\\n    -   login to NPM using your credentials if asked.\\n    -   enter the new version number using symver.\\n    -   wait for the code to be transpiled and published to NPM.\\n    -   wait for the styleguide to be built and deployed to GHPages.\\n3.  Visit your published library on NPM.\\n4.  Visit your deployed Styleguide on GHPages.\\n\\n### Deploying Styleguide to GHPages\\n\\nYou can optionally deploy the styleguide to GHPages without publishing to NPM.\\n\\n1.  Run `yarn deploy`\\n2.  There is a `predeploy` hook that builds the Styleguide.\\n3.

It tells about God creating heaven, earth, and the first humans. It also tells about the first time humans sinned. This caused humans to be separated from God and to eventually die. Genesis 1-11 briefly tells about other important events that occurred over many hundreds of years. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/death]])<br><br>Genesis is also about the beginning of God\\u2019s people. Genesis 12-50 tells about how God remained faithful to Abraham and his descendants. Abraham\\u2019s descendants became known as the Hebrews and later as the Israelites. These people would worship Yahweh and be his people.<br><br>Genesis ends with Abraham\\u2019s descendants living in Egypt with the hope of returning one day to the Promised Land. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>\\u201CGenesis\\u201D means \\u201Cbeginning,\\u201D so translators should express this idea in their title. Titles such as \\u201CThe Beginning of Things\\u201D may be suitable. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### Who wrote Genesis?<br><br>The writers of both the Old and New Testaments presented Moses as being very involved with writing the book of Genesis. Since ancient times, both Jews and Christians have thought that Moses wrote Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What are the covenants mentioned in Genesis?<br><br>A covenant is a formal, binding agreement between two parties that one or both parties must fulfill.<br><br>God made three covenants in Genesis. In the covenant with Adam, God promised to bless Adam and cause him to prosper. Adam was not allowed to eat fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. God promised that Adam would die if he disobeyed what he commanded.<br><br>In the covenant with Noah, God promised to never again destroy the world with a flood.<br><br>In the covenant with Abraham, God promised to make Abraham\\u2019s descendants into a great nation. He also promised to protect them and to give them a land of their own.<br><br>### What was God\\u2019s purpose for the book of Genesis?<br><br>The book of Genesis says that God created a very good world. However, the world became cursed because human beings began to sin. But Genesis shows that God continues to have complete control over the world.<br><br>Genesis also describes the start of God\\u2019s plan to bless the whole world again. This is shown when God makes a covenant with Abraham. With this covenant, God chose Abraham and his descendants to be his people. God promised to bless the world through Abraham\\u2019s descendants.<br><br>### What was the custom for inheritance as described by Genesis?<br><br>There are several passages in Genesis that show the customs of a father who is about to die passing on a blessing to his son. Abraham blessed his son, Isaac, and made him the ancestor of the people of Israel. However, Ishmael, Abraham\\u2019s other son, did not receive that same divine blessing. Likewise, Isaac\\u2019s older son Esau  did not receive the blessing. Isaac\\u2019s younger son, Jacob, received it instead. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/inherit]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/bless]])<br><br>Also, it was the custom for a man to divide among his sons his material wealth and land. All his sons received equal portions except the oldest son. The firstborn son received twice as much. His portion was called a double portion. Esau gave up his right to receive the double portion.<br><br>### How does Genesis present sin and evil?<br><br>Genesis presents sin as doing things that are against God\\u2019s word and God\\u2019s ways. It presents evil as the opposite of good.<br><br>Sin and evil have affected all people. This started when Adam disobeyed God in the Garden of Eden.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What is one way in which Genesis marks the beginning of important sections?<br><br>Genesis uses one Hebrew phrase that the ULT translates as \\u201Cthis is the record of,\\u201D \\u201Cthese were the events concerning,\\u201D or \\u201Cthese were the descendants of.\\u201D The information in these sections may have come from sources much older than Moses. These passages are 2:4; 5:1; 6:9; 10:1; 11:10, 27; 25:12, 19; 36:1, 9; 37:2.<br><br>If the translator wants to translate in only two ways, we recommend for most passages a phrase such as, \\u201Cthis is the record about\\u201D or \\u201Cthis is information about.\\u201D Some passages will be better translated, however, as \\u201CThese were the descendants of.\\u201D<br><br>### Why are the beginnings of some narrative sections in Genesis difficult to translate?<br><br>Often in Genesis, the author first summarizes what is about to happen. Then in the following verses, the author tells the details of what happened. Probable examples of this style occur in Gen. 1:1, 6:22, 18:1, 21:1 and 22:1.<br><br>However, in many languages, it is preferred to write summaries at the end of a narrative. In this case, translators may choose a different approach. For example, in Gen. 1:1 (\\u201CIn the beginning God created the heavens and the earth\\u201D), translators may decide to translate like this: \\u201CThis is about how God made the heavens and the earth in the beginning.\\u201D<br><br>### What is the difference between \\u201Cpeople,\\u201D \\u201Cpeoples,\\u201D and \\u201Cpeople groups\\u201D?<br><br>The word \\u201Cpeople\\u201D refers to all the individuals who belong to a group, such as \\u201Cthe people of Israel.\\u201D The word \\u201Cpeoples\\u201D (used in the ULT) refers to multiple groups of people. Each people group might speak their own language, have their own customs, and worships their own gods. Some different peoples in the ancient Near East were those of Israel, Egypt, Edom, Moab, and Ammon.<br><br>The expression \\u201Cpeople groups\\u201D (used in the UST) means the same thing as \\u201Cpeoples\\u201D in the ULT. The translator should use the most equivalent term that is common in the project language.<br><br>### What is the relationship between individuals and peoples that have similar names?<br><br>Many individuals in Genesis eventually had large numbers of descendants who were called after their ancestor\\u2019s name. For example, Cush was the name of an individual. But, \\u201CCush\\u201D also became the name of nation that his descendants formed. They were called \\u201CCushites.\\u201D If possible, when translating these names, the translator should make the individual\\u2019s name and the nation\\u2019s name similar. Examples of this are \\u201CCush\\u201D and \\u201CCushite\\u201D or \\u201CMoab\\u201D and \\u201CMoabite.\\u201D Otherwise, the translator may say, \\u201Cthe descendants of Cush\\u201D or \\u201Cthe descendants of Moab.\\u201D<br><br>### What do the phrases \\u201Cto this day\\u201D or \\u201Cof today\\u201D mean?<br><br>These phrases were used by the narrator to refer to the time when he was writing. The translator should be aware that \\u201Cto this day\\u201D and \\u201Cof today\\u201D refer to a time already passed. The translator might decide to say, \\u201Cto this day, at the time when this is being written,\\u201D or, \\u201Cto this day, at the time of writing.\\u201D This Hebrew phrase occurs in Gen. 19:37, 19:38, 22:14, 26:33, 32:32, 35:20, 47:26, 48:18.\";\\nconst lineA2 = \"1:intro\\\\tzb6f\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t0\\\\t\\\\t# Genesis 01 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This chapter presents the first account of God creating the world. There is a pattern to this account: \\u201CGod said\\u2026God saw that it was good\\u2026This was evening and morning, the first day.\\u201D Translators should preserve this pattern in their versions.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The universe<br><br>This account of creation is told within the framework of ancient Hebrew ideas about the universe: the earth was resting with water around it and below it. Over the earth was something like a vast dome, called \\u201Can expanse between the waters\\u201D (1:6), on top of which was more water. Translators should try to keep these original images in their work, even though readers in their project language might have a completely different idea of what the universe is like.<br><br>### Evening and morning<br><br>Genesis 1 presents the ancient Hebrew idea of a day: it begins with sunset, lasts through the night and continues through the daylight hours until the next sunset. This pattern should be preserved in translation, even if readers in the project language define \\u201Cday\\u201D differently.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### \\u201CIn the beginning\\u201D<br><br>Some languages and cultures speak of the world as if it has always existed, as if it had no beginning. But \\u201Cvery long ago\\u201D is different from \\u201Cin the beginning,\\u201D and you need to be sure that your translation communicates correctly.<br><br>### \\u201CGod said, \\u2018Let there be\\u2019\\u201D<br><br>This expression occurs often in this chapter. It can be difficult to translate, because God is not shown as talking to a particular person. If God is talking to a thing, it is something not yet in existence. Translators should find the most natural way in the project language to signal the idea that God spoke things into existence; he created the world and the things in it by simply commanding that they should exist.\";\\nconst lineA3 = \"1:1\\\\tf2mg\\\\t\\\\t0\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tIn the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth \\u201CThis is about how God made the heavens and the earth in the beginning.\\u201D This statement summarizes the rest of the chapter.

This started when Adam disobeyed God in the Garden of Eden.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What is one way in which Genesis marks the beginning of important sections?<br><br>Genesis uses one Hebrew phrase that the ULT translates as \\u201Cthis is the record of,\\u201D \\u201Cthese were the events concerning,\\u201D or \\u201Cthese were the descendants of.\\u201D The information in these sections may have come from sources much older than Moses. These passages are 2:4; 5:1; 6:9; 10:1; 11:10, 27; 25:12, 19; 36:1, 9; 37:2.<br><br>If the translator wants to translate in only two ways, we recommend for most passages a phrase such as, \\u201Cthis is the record about\\u201D or \\u201Cthis is information about.\\u201D Some passages will be better translated, however, as \\u201CThese were the descendants of.\\u201D<br><br>### Why are the beginnings of some narrative sections in Genesis difficult to translate?<br><br>Often in Genesis, the author first summarizes what is about to happen. Then in the following verses, the author tells the details of what happened. Probable examples of this style occur in Gen. 1:1, 6:22, 18:1, 21:1 and 22:1.<br><br>However, in many languages, it is preferred to write summaries at the end of a narrative. In this case, translators may choose a different approach. For example, in Gen. 1:1 (\\u201CIn the beginning God created the heavens and the earth\\u201D), translators may decide to translate like this: \\u201CThis is about how God made the heavens and the earth in the beginning.\\u201D<br><br>### What is the difference between \\u201Cpeople,\\u201D \\u201Cpeoples,\\u201D and \\u201Cpeople groups\\u201D?<br><br>The word \\u201Cpeople\\u201D refers to all the individuals who belong to a group, such as \\u201Cthe people of Israel.\\u201D The word \\u201Cpeoples\\u201D (used in the ULT) refers to multiple groups of people. Each people group might speak their own language, have their own customs, and worships their own gods. Some different peoples in the ancient Near East were those of Israel, Egypt, Edom, Moab, and Ammon.<br><br>The expression \\u201Cpeople groups\\u201D (used in the UST) means the same thing as \\u201Cpeoples\\u201D in the ULT. The translator should use the most equivalent term that is common in the project language.<br><br>### What is the relationship between individuals and peoples that have similar names?<br><br>Many individuals in Genesis eventually had large numbers of descendants who were called after their ancestor\\u2019s name. For example, Cush was the name of an individual. But, \\u201CCush\\u201D also became the name of nation that his descendants formed. They were called \\u201CCushites.\\u201D If possible, when translating these names, the translator should make the individual\\u2019s name and the nation\\u2019s name similar. Examples of this are \\u201CCush\\u201D and \\u201CCushite\\u201D or \\u201CMoab\\u201D and \\u201CMoabite.\\u201D Otherwise, the translator may say, \\u201Cthe descendants of Cush\\u201D or \\u201Cthe descendants of Moab.\\u201D<br><br>### What do the phrases \\u201Cto this day\\u201D or \\u201Cof today\\u201D mean?<br><br>These phrases were used by the narrator to refer to the time when he was writing. The translator should be aware that \\u201Cto this day\\u201D and \\u201Cof today\\u201D refer to a time already passed. The translator might decide to say, \\u201Cto this day, at the time when this is being written,\\u201D or, \\u201Cto this day, at the time of writing.\\u201D This Hebrew phrase occurs in Gen. 19:37, 19:38, 22:14, 26:33, 32:32, 35:20, 47:26, 48:18.\";\\nconst lineA2 = \"1:intro\\\\tzb6f\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t0\\\\t# Genesis 01 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This chapter presents the first account of God creating the world.

Over the earth was something like a vast dome, called \\u201Can expanse between the waters\\u201D (1:6), on top of which was more water. Translators should try to keep these original images in their work, even though readers in their project language might have a completely different idea of what the universe is like.<br><br>### Evening and morning<br><br>Genesis 1 presents the ancient Hebrew idea of a day: it begins with sunset, lasts through the night and continues through the daylight hours until the next sunset.

It can be difficult to translate, because God is not shown as talking to a particular person. If God is talking to a thing, it is something not yet in existence. Translators should find the most natural way in the project language to signal the idea that God spoke things into existence; he created the world and the things in it by simply commanding that they should exist.\\n1:1\\\\tf2mg\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t0\\\\t\\\\tIn the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth \\u201CThis is about how God made the heavens and the earth in the beginning.\\u201D This statement summarizes the rest of the chapter.

It tells about God creating heaven, earth, and the first humans. It also tells about the first time humans sinned. This caused humans to be separated from God and to eventually die. Genesis 1-11 briefly tells about other important events that occurred over many hundreds of years. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/death]])<br><br>Genesis is also about the beginning of God\\u2019s people. Genesis 12-50 tells about how God remained faithful to Abraham and his descendants. Abraham\\u2019s descendants became known as the Hebrews and later as the Israelites. These people would worship Yahweh and be his people.<br><br>Genesis ends with Abraham\\u2019s descendants living in Egypt with the hope of returning one day to the Promised Land. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>\\u201CGenesis\\u201D means \\u201Cbeginning,\\u201D so translators should express this idea in their title. Titles such as \\u201CThe Beginning of Things\\u201D may be suitable. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### Who wrote Genesis?<br><br>The writers of both the Old and New Testaments presented Moses as being very involved with writing the book of Genesis. Since ancient times, both Jews and Christians have thought that Moses wrote Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What are the covenants mentioned in Genesis?<br><br>A covenant is a formal, binding agreement between two parties that one or both parties must fulfill.<br><br>God made three covenants in Genesis. In the covenant with Adam, God promised to bless Adam and cause him to prosper. Adam was not allowed to eat fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. God promised that Adam would die if he disobeyed what he commanded.<br><br>In the covenant with Noah, God promised to never again destroy the world with a flood.<br><br>In the covenant with Abraham, God promised to make Abraham\\u2019s descendants into a great nation. He also promised to protect them and to give them a land of their own.<br><br>### What was God\\u2019s purpose for the book of Genesis?<br><br>The book of Genesis says that God created a very good world. However, the world became cursed because human beings began to sin. But Genesis shows that God continues to have complete control over the world.<br><br>Genesis also describes the start of God\\u2019s plan to bless the whole world again. This is shown when God makes a covenant with Abraham. With this covenant, God chose Abraham and his descendants to be his people. God promised to bless the world through Abraham\\u2019s descendants.<br><br>### What was the custom for inheritance as described by Genesis?<br><br>There are several passages in Genesis that show the customs of a father who is about to die passing on a blessing to his son. Abraham blessed his son, Isaac, and made him the ancestor of the people of Israel. However, Ishmael, Abraham\\u2019s other son, did not receive that same divine blessing. Likewise, Isaac\\u2019s older son Esau  did not receive the blessing. Isaac\\u2019s younger son, Jacob, received it instead. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/inherit]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/bless]])<br><br>Also, it was the custom for a man to divide among his sons his material wealth and land. All his sons received equal portions except the oldest son. The firstborn son received twice as much. His portion was called a double portion. Esau gave up his right to receive the double portion.<br><br>### How does Genesis present sin and evil?<br><br>Genesis presents sin as doing things that are against God\\u2019s word and God\\u2019s ways. It presents evil as the opposite of good.<br><br>Sin and evil have affected all people. This started when Adam disobeyed God in the Garden of Eden.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What is one way in which Genesis marks the beginning of important sections?<br><br>Genesis uses one Hebrew phrase that the ULT translates as \\u201Cthis is the record of,\\u201D \\u201Cthese were the events concerning,\\u201D or \\u201Cthese were the descendants of.\\u201D The information in these sections may have come from sources much older than Moses. These passages are 2:4; 5:1; 6:9; 10:1; 11:10, 27; 25:12, 19; 36:1, 9; 37:2.<br><br>If the translator wants to translate in only two ways, we recommend for most passages a phrase such as, \\u201Cthis is the record about\\u201D or \\u201Cthis is information about.\\u201D Some passages will be better translated, however, as \\u201CThese were the descendants of.\\u201D<br><br>### Why are the beginnings of some narrative sections in Genesis difficult to translate?<br><br>Often in Genesis, the author first summarizes what is about to happen. Then in the following verses, the author tells the details of what happened. Probable examples of this style occur in Gen. 1:1, 6:22, 18:1, 21:1 and 22:1.<br><br>However, in many languages, it is preferred to write summaries at the end of a narrative. In this case, translators may choose a different approach. For example, in Gen. 1:1 (\\u201CIn the beginning God created the heavens and the earth\\u201D), translators may decide to translate like this: \\u201CThis is about how God made the heavens and the earth in the beginning.\\u201D<br><br>### What is the difference between \\u201Cpeople,\\u201D \\u201Cpeoples,\\u201D and \\u201Cpeople groups\\u201D?<br><br>The word \\u201Cpeople\\u201D refers to all the individuals who belong to a group, such as \\u201Cthe people of Israel.\\u201D The word \\u201Cpeoples\\u201D (used in the ULT) refers to multiple groups of people. Each people group might speak their own language, have their own customs, and worships their own gods. Some different peoples in the ancient Near East were those of Israel, Egypt, Edom, Moab, and Ammon.<br><br>The expression \\u201Cpeople groups\\u201D (used in the UST) means the same thing as \\u201Cpeoples\\u201D in the ULT. The translator should use the most equivalent term that is common in the project language.<br><br>### What is the relationship between individuals and peoples that have similar names?<br><br>Many individuals in Genesis eventually had large numbers of descendants who were called after their ancestor\\u2019s name. For example, Cush was the name of an individual. But, \\u201CCush\\u201D also became the name of nation that his descendants formed. They were called \\u201CCushites.\\u201D If possible, when translating these names, the translator should make the individual\\u2019s name and the nation\\u2019s name similar. Examples of this are \\u201CCush\\u201D and \\u201CCushite\\u201D or \\u201CMoab\\u201D and \\u201CMoabite.\\u201D Otherwise, the translator may say, \\u201Cthe descendants of Cush\\u201D or \\u201Cthe descendants of Moab.\\u201D<br><br>### What do the phrases \\u201Cto this day\\u201D or \\u201Cof today\\u201D mean?<br><br>These phrases were used by the narrator to refer to the time when he was writing.

From the Creation to the Tower of Babel<br>- The account of the creation of the heavens and the earth (1:1\\u20134:26)<br>- The account of Adam (5:1\\u20136:8)<br>- The account of Noah (6:9\\u201311:9)<br>- The account of Shem (11:10\\u201311:26)<br>- The account of Terah (11:27\\u201311:32)<br>1. The accounts of the Patriarchs<br>- The account of Abraham (12:1-25:11)<br>- The account of Ishmael (25:12\\u201325:18)<br>- The account of Isaac, focusing on Jacob (25:19\\u201335:29)<br>- The account of Esau (36:1\\u201337:1)<br>- The account of Jacob, focusing on Joseph (37:2\\u201350:26)<br><br>### What is Genesis about?<br><br>Genesis begins with the early years of creation. It tells about God creating heaven, earth, and the first humans. It also tells about the first time humans sinned. This caused humans to be separated from God and to eventually die. Genesis 1-11 briefly tells about other important events that occurred over many hundreds of years. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/death]])<br><br>Genesis is also about the beginning of God\\u2019s people. Genesis 12-50 tells about how God remained faithful to Abraham and his descendants. Abraham\\u2019s descendants became known as the Hebrews and later as the Israelites. These people would worship Yahweh and be his people.<br><br>Genesis ends with Abraham\\u2019s descendants living in Egypt with the hope of returning one day to the Promised Land. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>\\u201CGenesis\\u201D means \\u201Cbeginning,\\u201D so translators should express this idea in their title. Titles such as \\u201CThe Beginning of Things\\u201D may be suitable. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### Who wrote Genesis?<br><br>The writers of both the Old and New Testaments presented Moses as being very involved with writing the book of Genesis. Since ancient times, both Jews and Christians have thought that Moses wrote Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What are the covenants mentioned in Genesis?<br><br>A covenant is a formal, binding agreement between two parties that one or both parties must fulfill.<br><br>God made three covenants in Genesis. In the covenant with Adam, God promised to bless Adam and cause him to prosper. Adam was not allowed to eat fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. God promised that Adam would die if he disobeyed what he commanded.<br><br>In the covenant with Noah, God promised to never again destroy the world with a flood.<br><br>In the covenant with Abraham, God promised to make Abraham\\u2019s descendants into a great nation. He also promised to protect them and to give them a land of their own.<br><br>### What was God\\u2019s purpose for the book of Genesis?<br><br>The book of Genesis says that God created a very good world. However, the world became cursed because human beings began to sin. But Genesis shows that God continues to have complete control over the world.<br><br>Genesis also describes the start of God\\u2019s plan to bless the whole world again. This is shown when God makes a covenant with Abraham. With this covenant, God chose Abraham and his descendants to be his people. God promised to bless the world through Abraham\\u2019s descendants.<br><br>### What was the custom for inheritance as described by Genesis?<br><br>There are several passages in Genesis that show the customs of a father who is about to die passing on a blessing to his son. Abraham blessed his son, Isaac, and made him the ancestor of the people of Israel. However, Ishmael, Abraham\\u2019s other son, did not receive that same divine blessing. Likewise, Isaac\\u2019s older son Esau  did not receive the blessing. Isaac\\u2019s younger son, Jacob, received it instead. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/inherit]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/bless]])<br><br>Also, it was the custom for a man to divide among his sons his material wealth and land. All his sons received equal portions except the oldest son. The firstborn son received twice as much. His portion was called a double portion. Esau gave up his right to receive the double portion.<br><br>### How does Genesis present sin and evil?<br><br>Genesis presents sin as doing things that are against God\\u2019s word and God\\u2019s ways. It presents evil as the opposite of good.<br><br>Sin and evil have affected all people. This started when Adam disobeyed God in the Garden of Eden.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What is one way in which Genesis marks the beginning of important sections?<br><br>Genesis uses one Hebrew phrase that the ULT translates as \\u201Cthis is the record of,\\u201D \\u201Cthese were the events concerning,\\u201D or \\u201Cthese were the descendants of.\\u201D The information in these sections may have come from sources much older than Moses. These passages are 2:4; 5:1; 6:9; 10:1; 11:10, 27; 25:12, 19; 36:1, 9; 37:2.<br><br>If the translator wants to translate in only two ways, we recommend for most passages a phrase such as, \\u201Cthis is the record about\\u201D or \\u201Cthis is information about.\\u201D Some passages will be better translated, however, as \\u201CThese were the descendants of.\\u201D<br><br>### Why are the beginnings of some narrative sections in Genesis difficult to translate?<br><br>Often in Genesis, the author first summarizes what is about to happen. Then in the following verses, the author tells the details of what happened. Probable examples of this style occur in Gen. 1:1, 6:22, 18:1, 21:1 and 22:1.<br><br>However, in many languages, it is preferred to write summaries at the end of a narrative. In this case, translators may choose a different approach. For example, in Gen. 1:1 (\\u201CIn the beginning God created the heavens and the earth\\u201D), translators may decide to translate like this: \\u201CThis is about how God made the heavens and the earth in the beginning.\\u201D<br><br>### What is the difference between \\u201Cpeople,\\u201D \\u201Cpeoples,\\u201D and \\u201Cpeople groups\\u201D?<br><br>The word \\u201Cpeople\\u201D refers to all the individuals who belong to a group, such as \\u201Cthe people of Israel.\\u201D The word \\u201Cpeoples\\u201D (used in the ULT) refers to multiple groups of people. Each people group might speak their own language, have their own customs, and worships their own gods. Some different peoples in the ancient Near East were those of Israel, Egypt, Edom, Moab, and Ammon.<br><br>The expression \\u201Cpeople groups\\u201D (used in the UST) means the same thing as \\u201Cpeoples\\u201D in the ULT. The translator should use the most equivalent term that is common in the project language.<br><br>### What is the relationship between individuals and peoples that have similar names?<br><br>Many individuals in Genesis eventually had large numbers of descendants who were called after their ancestor\\u2019s name. For example, Cush was the name of an individual. But, \\u201CCush\\u201D also became the name of nation that his descendants formed. They were called \\u201CCushites.\\u201D If possible, when translating these names, the translator should make the individual\\u2019s name and the nation\\u2019s name similar. Examples of this are \\u201CCush\\u201D and \\u201CCushite\\u201D or \\u201CMoab\\u201D and \\u201CMoabite.\\u201D Otherwise, the translator may say, \\u201Cthe descendants of Cush\\u201D or \\u201Cthe descendants of Moab.\\u201D<br><br>### What do the phrases \\u201Cto this day\\u201D or \\u201Cof today\\u201D mean?<br><br>These phrases were used by the narrator to refer to the time when he was writing. The translator should be aware that \\u201Cto this day\\u201D and \\u201Cof today\\u201D refer to a time already passed. The translator might decide to say, \\u201Cto this day, at the time when this is being written,\\u201D or, \\u201Cto this day, at the time of writing.\\u201D This Hebrew phrase occurs in Gen. 19:37, 19:38, 22:14, 26:33, 32:32, 35:20, 47:26, 48:18.\";\\nconst lineA2 = \"1:intro\\\\tzb6f\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t0\\\\t# Genesis 01 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This chapter presents the first account of God creating the world.

It tells about God creating heaven, earth, and the first humans. It also tells about the first time humans sinned. This caused humans to be separated from God and to eventually die. Genesis 1-11 briefly tells about other important events that occurred over many hundreds of years. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/death]])<br><br>Genesis is also about the beginning of God\\u2019s people. Genesis 12-50 tells about how God remained faithful to Abraham and his descendants. Abraham\\u2019s descendants became known as the Hebrews and later as the Israelites. These people would worship Yahweh and be his people.<br><br>Genesis ends with Abraham\\u2019s descendants living in Egypt with the hope of returning one day to the Promised Land. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>\\u201CGenesis\\u201D means \\u201Cbeginning,\\u201D so translators should express this idea in their title. Titles such as \\u201CThe Beginning of Things\\u201D may be suitable. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### Who wrote Genesis?<br><br>The writers of both the Old and New Testaments presented Moses as being very involved with writing the book of Genesis. Since ancient times, both Jews and Christians have thought that Moses wrote Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What are the covenants mentioned in Genesis?<br><br>A covenant is a formal, binding agreement between two parties that one or both parties must fulfill.<br><br>God made three covenants in Genesis. In the covenant with Adam, God promised to bless Adam and cause him to prosper. Adam was not allowed to eat fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. God promised that Adam would die if he disobeyed what he commanded.<br><br>In the covenant with Noah, God promised to never again destroy the world with a flood.<br><br>In the covenant with Abraham, God promised to make Abraham\\u2019s descendants into a great nation. He also promised to protect them and to give them a land of their own.<br><br>### What was God\\u2019s purpose for the book of Genesis?<br><br>The book of Genesis says that God created a very good world. However, the world became cursed because human beings began to sin. But Genesis shows that God continues to have complete control over the world.<br><br>Genesis also describes the start of God\\u2019s plan to bless the whole world again. This is shown when God makes a covenant with Abraham. With this covenant, God chose Abraham and his descendants to be his people. God promised to bless the world through Abraham\\u2019s descendants.<br><br>### What was the custom for inheritance as described by Genesis?<br><br>There are several passages in Genesis that show the customs of a father who is about to die passing on a blessing to his son. Abraham blessed his son, Isaac, and made him the ancestor of the people of Israel. However, Ishmael, Abraham\\u2019s other son, did not receive that same divine blessing. Likewise, Isaac\\u2019s older son Esau  did not receive the blessing. Isaac\\u2019s younger son, Jacob, received it instead. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/inherit]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/bless]])<br><br>Also, it was the custom for a man to divide among his sons his material wealth and land. All his sons received equal portions except the oldest son. The firstborn son received twice as much. His portion was called a double portion. Esau gave up his right to receive the double portion.<br><br>### How does Genesis present sin and evil?<br><br>Genesis presents sin as doing things that are against God\\u2019s word and God\\u2019s ways. It presents evil as the opposite of good.<br><br>Sin and evil have affected all people. This started when Adam disobeyed God in the Garden of Eden.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What is one way in which Genesis marks the beginning of important sections?<br><br>Genesis uses one Hebrew phrase that the ULT translates as \\u201Cthis is the record of,\\u201D \\u201Cthese were the events concerning,\\u201D or \\u201Cthese were the descendants of.\\u201D The information in these sections may have come from sources much older than Moses. These passages are 2:4; 5:1; 6:9; 10:1; 11:10, 27; 25:12, 19; 36:1, 9; 37:2.<br><br>If the translator wants to translate in only two ways, we recommend for most passages a phrase such as, \\u201Cthis is the record about\\u201D or \\u201Cthis is information about.\\u201D Some passages will be better translated, however, as \\u201CThese were the descendants of.\\u201D<br><br>### Why are the beginnings of some narrative sections in Genesis difficult to translate?<br><br>Often in Genesis, the author first summarizes what is about to happen. Then in the following verses, the author tells the details of what happened. Probable examples of this style occur in Gen. 1:1, 6:22, 18:1, 21:1 and 22:1.<br><br>However, in many languages, it is preferred to write summaries at the end of a narrative. In this case, translators may choose a different approach. For example, in Gen. 1:1 (\\u201CIn the beginning God created the heavens and the earth\\u201D), translators may decide to translate like this: \\u201CThis is about how God made the heavens and the earth in the beginning.\\u201D<br><br>### What is the difference between \\u201Cpeople,\\u201D \\u201Cpeoples,\\u201D and \\u201Cpeople groups\\u201D?<br><br>The word \\u201Cpeople\\u201D refers to all the individuals who belong to a group, such as \\u201Cthe people of Israel.\\u201D The word \\u201Cpeoples\\u201D (used in the ULT) refers to multiple groups of people. Each people group might speak their own language, have their own customs, and worships their own gods. Some different peoples in the ancient Near East were those of Israel, Egypt, Edom, Moab, and Ammon.<br><br>The expression \\u201Cpeople groups\\u201D (used in the UST) means the same thing as \\u201Cpeoples\\u201D in the ULT. The translator should use the most equivalent term that is common in the project language.<br><br>### What is the relationship between individuals and peoples that have similar names?<br><br>Many individuals in Genesis eventually had large numbers of descendants who were called after their ancestor\\u2019s name. For example, Cush was the name of an individual. But, \\u201CCush\\u201D also became the name of nation that his descendants formed. They were called \\u201CCushites.\\u201D If possible, when translating these names, the translator should make the individual\\u2019s name and the nation\\u2019s name similar. Examples of this are \\u201CCush\\u201D and \\u201CCushite\\u201D or \\u201CMoab\\u201D and \\u201CMoabite.\\u201D Otherwise, the translator may say, \\u201Cthe descendants of Cush\\u201D or \\u201Cthe descendants of Moab.\\u201D<br><br>### What do the phrases \\u201Cto this day\\u201D or \\u201Cof today\\u201D mean?<br><br>These phrases were used by the narrator to refer to the time when he was writing. The translator should be aware that \\u201Cto this day\\u201D and \\u201Cof today\\u201D refer to a time already passed. The translator might decide to say, \\u201Cto this day, at the time when this is being written,\\u201D or, \\u201Cto this day, at the time of writing.\\u201D This Hebrew phrase occurs in Gen. 19:37, 19:38, 22:14, 26:33, 32:32, 35:20, 47:26, 48:18.\";\\nconst lineA2 = \"GEN\\\\t1\\\\tintro\\\\tzb6f\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t0\\\\t\\\\t# Genesis 01 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This chapter presents the first account of God creating the world. There is a pattern to this account: \\u201CGod said\\u2026God saw that it was good\\u2026This was evening and morning, the first day.\\u201D Translators should preserve this pattern in their versions.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The universe<br><br>This account of creation is told within the framework of ancient Hebrew ideas about the universe: the earth was resting with water around it and below it. Over the earth was something like a vast dome, called \\u201Can expanse between the waters\\u201D (1:6), on top of which was more water. Translators should try to keep these original images in their work, even though readers in their project language might have a completely different idea of what the universe is like.<br><br>### Evening and morning<br><br>Genesis 1 presents the ancient Hebrew idea of a day: it begins with sunset, lasts through the night and continues through the daylight hours until the next sunset. This pattern should be preserved in translation, even if readers in the project language define \\u201Cday\\u201D differently.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### \\u201CIn the beginning\\u201D<br><br>Some languages and cultures speak of the world as if it has always existed, as if it had no beginning.

It can be difficult to translate, because God is not shown as talking to a particular person. If God is talking to a thing, it is something not yet in existence.

(See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/inherit]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/bless]])<br><br>Also, it was the custom for a man to divide among his sons his material wealth and land. All his sons received equal portions except the oldest son. The firstborn son received twice as much. His portion was called a double portion. Esau gave up his right to receive the double portion.<br><br>### How does Genesis present sin and evil?<br><br>Genesis presents sin as doing things that are against God\\u2019s word and God\\u2019s ways. It presents evil as the opposite of good.<br><br>Sin and evil have affected all people. This started when Adam disobeyed God in the Garden of Eden.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What is one way in which Genesis marks the beginning of important sections?<br><br>Genesis uses one Hebrew phrase that the ULT translates as \\u201Cthis is the record of,\\u201D \\u201Cthese were the events concerning,\\u201D or \\u201Cthese were the descendants of.\\u201D The information in these sections may have come from sources much older than Moses. These passages are 2:4; 5:1; 6:9; 10:1; 11:10, 27; 25:12, 19; 36:1, 9; 37:2.<br><br>If the translator wants to translate in only two ways, we recommend for most passages a phrase such as, \\u201Cthis is the record about\\u201D or \\u201Cthis is information about.\\u201D Some passages will be better translated, however, as \\u201CThese were the descendants of.\\u201D<br><br>### Why are the beginnings of some narrative sections in Genesis difficult to translate?<br><br>Often in Genesis, the author first summarizes what is about to happen. Then in the following verses, the author tells the details of what happened. Probable examples of this style occur in Gen. 1:1, 6:22, 18:1, 21:1 and 22:1.<br><br>However, in many languages, it is preferred to write summaries at the end of a narrative. In this case, translators may choose a different approach. For example, in Gen. 1:1 (\\u201CIn the beginning God created the heavens and the earth\\u201D), translators may decide to translate like this: \\u201CThis is about how God made the heavens and the earth in the beginning.\\u201D<br><br>### What is the difference between \\u201Cpeople,\\u201D \\u201Cpeoples,\\u201D and \\u201Cpeople groups\\u201D?<br><br>The word \\u201Cpeople\\u201D refers to all the individuals who belong to a group, such as \\u201Cthe people of Israel.\\u201D The word \\u201Cpeoples\\u201D (used in the ULT) refers to multiple groups of people. Each people group might speak their own language, have their own customs, and worships their own gods. Some different peoples in the ancient Near East were those of Israel, Egypt, Edom, Moab, and Ammon.<br><br>The expression \\u201Cpeople groups\\u201D (used in the UST) means the same thing as \\u201Cpeoples\\u201D in the ULT. The translator should use the most equivalent term that is common in the project language.<br><br>### What is the relationship between individuals and peoples that have similar names?<br><br>Many individuals in Genesis eventually had large numbers of descendants who were called after their ancestor\\u2019s name. For example, Cush was the name of an individual. But, \\u201CCush\\u201D also became the name of nation that his descendants formed. They were called \\u201CCushites.\\u201D If possible, when translating these names, the translator should make the individual\\u2019s name and the nation\\u2019s name similar. Examples of this are \\u201CCush\\u201D and \\u201CCushite\\u201D or \\u201CMoab\\u201D and \\u201CMoabite.\\u201D Otherwise, the translator may say, \\u201Cthe descendants of Cush\\u201D or \\u201Cthe descendants of Moab.\\u201D<br><br>### What do the phrases \\u201Cto this day\\u201D or \\u201Cof today\\u201D mean?<br><br>These phrases were used by the narrator to refer to the time when he was writing. The translator should be aware that \\u201Cto this day\\u201D and \\u201Cof today\\u201D refer to a time already passed. The translator might decide to say, \\u201Cto this day, at the time when this is being written,\\u201D or, \\u201Cto this day, at the time of writing.\\u201D This Hebrew phrase occurs in Gen. 19:37, 19:38, 22:14, 26:33, 32:32, 35:20, 47:26, 48:18.\";\\nconst lineA2 = \"GEN\\\\t1\\\\tintro\\\\tzb6f\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t0\\\\t\\\\t# Genesis 01 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This chapter presents the first account of God creating the world. There is a pattern to this account: \\u201CGod said\\u2026God saw that it was good\\u2026This was evening and morning, the first day.\\u201D Translators should preserve this pattern in their versions.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The universe<br><br>This account of creation is told within the framework of ancient Hebrew ideas about the universe: the earth was resting with water around it and below it. Over the earth was something like a vast dome, called \\u201Can expanse between the waters\\u201D (1:6), on top of which was more water. Translators should try to keep these original images in their work, even though readers in their project language might have a completely different idea of what the universe is like.<br><br>### Evening and morning<br><br>Genesis 1 presents the ancient Hebrew idea of a day: it begins with sunset, lasts through the night and continues through the daylight hours until the next sunset. This pattern should be preserved in translation, even if readers in the project language define \\u201Cday\\u201D differently.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### \\u201CIn the beginning\\u201D<br><br>Some languages and cultures speak of the world as if it has always existed, as if it had no beginning.

It can be difficult to translate, because God is not shown as talking to a particular person. If God is talking to a thing, it is something not yet in existence. Translators should find the most natural way in the project language to signal the idea that God spoke things into existence; he created the world and the things in it by simply commanding that they should exist.\\nGEN\\\\t1\\\\t1\\\\tf2mg\\\\t\\\\t0\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tIn the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth \\u201CThis is about how God made the heavens and the earth in the beginning.\\u201D This statement summarizes the rest of the chapter.

It tells about God creating heaven, earth, and the first humans. It also tells about the first time humans sinned. This caused humans to be separated from God and to eventually die. Genesis 1-11 briefly tells about other important events that occurred over many hundreds of years. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/death]])<br><br>Genesis is also about the beginning of God\\u2019s people. Genesis 12-50 tells about how God remained faithful to Abraham and his descendants. Abraham\\u2019s descendants became known as the Hebrews and later as the Israelites. These people would worship Yahweh and be his people.<br><br>Genesis ends with Abraham\\u2019s descendants living in Egypt with the hope of returning one day to the Promised Land. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>\\u201CGenesis\\u201D means \\u201Cbeginning,\\u201D so translators should express this idea in their title. Titles such as \\u201CThe Beginning of Things\\u201D may be suitable. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### Who wrote Genesis?<br><br>The writers of both the Old and New Testaments presented Moses as being very involved with writing the book of Genesis. Since ancient times, both Jews and Christians have thought that Moses wrote Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What are the covenants mentioned in Genesis?<br><br>A covenant is a formal, binding agreement between two parties that one or both parties must fulfill.<br><br>God made three covenants in Genesis. In the covenant with Adam, God promised to bless Adam and cause him to prosper. Adam was not allowed to eat fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. God promised that Adam would die if he disobeyed what he commanded.<br><br>In the covenant with Noah, God promised to never again destroy the world with a flood.<br><br>In the covenant with Abraham, God promised to make Abraham\\u2019s descendants into a great nation. He also promised to protect them and to give them a land of their own.<br><br>### What was God\\u2019s purpose for the book of Genesis?<br><br>The book of Genesis says that God created a very good world. However, the world became cursed because human beings began to sin. But Genesis shows that God continues to have complete control over the world.<br><br>Genesis also describes the start of God\\u2019s plan to bless the whole world again. This is shown when God makes a covenant with Abraham. With this covenant, God chose Abraham and his descendants to be his people. God promised to bless the world through Abraham\\u2019s descendants.<br><br>### What was the custom for inheritance as described by Genesis?<br><br>There are several passages in Genesis that show the customs of a father who is about to die passing on a blessing to his son. Abraham blessed his son, Isaac, and made him the ancestor of the people of Israel. However, Ishmael, Abraham\\u2019s other son, did not receive that same divine blessing. Likewise, Isaac\\u2019s older son Esau  did not receive the blessing. Isaac\\u2019s younger son, Jacob, received it instead. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/inherit]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/bless]])<br><br>Also, it was the custom for a man to divide among his sons his material wealth and land. All his sons received equal portions except the oldest son. The firstborn son received twice as much. His portion was called a double portion. Esau gave up his right to receive the double portion.<br><br>### How does Genesis present sin and evil?<br><br>Genesis presents sin as doing things that are against God\\u2019s word and God\\u2019s ways. It presents evil as the opposite of good.<br><br>Sin and evil have affected all people. This started when Adam disobeyed God in the Garden of Eden.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What is one way in which Genesis marks the beginning of important sections?<br><br>Genesis uses one Hebrew phrase that the ULT translates as \\u201Cthis is the record of,\\u201D \\u201Cthese were the events concerning,\\u201D or \\u201Cthese were the descendants of.\\u201D The information in these sections may have come from sources much older than Moses. These passages are 2:4; 5:1; 6:9; 10:1; 11:10, 27; 25:12, 19; 36:1, 9; 37:2.<br><br>If the translator wants to translate in only two ways, we recommend for most passages a phrase such as, \\u201Cthis is the record about\\u201D or \\u201Cthis is information about.\\u201D Some passages will be better translated, however, as \\u201CThese were the descendants of.\\u201D<br><br>### Why are the beginnings of some narrative sections in Genesis difficult to translate?<br><br>Often in Genesis, the author first summarizes what is about to happen. Then in the following verses, the author tells the details of what happened. Probable examples of this style occur in Gen. 1:1, 6:22, 18:1, 21:1 and 22:1.<br><br>However, in many languages, it is preferred to write summaries at the end of a narrative. In this case, translators may choose a different approach. For example, in Gen. 1:1 (\\u201CIn the beginning God created the heavens and the earth\\u201D), translators may decide to translate like this: \\u201CThis is about how God made the heavens and the earth in the beginning.\\u201D<br><br>### What is the difference between \\u201Cpeople,\\u201D \\u201Cpeoples,\\u201D and \\u201Cpeople groups\\u201D?<br><br>The word \\u201Cpeople\\u201D refers to all the individuals who belong to a group, such as \\u201Cthe people of Israel.\\u201D The word \\u201Cpeoples\\u201D (used in the ULT) refers to multiple groups of people. Each people group might speak their own language, have their own customs, and worships their own gods. Some different peoples in the ancient Near East were those of Israel, Egypt, Edom, Moab, and Ammon.<br><br>The expression \\u201Cpeople groups\\u201D (used in the UST) means the same thing as \\u201Cpeoples\\u201D in the ULT. The translator should use the most equivalent term that is common in the project language.<br><br>### What is the relationship between individuals and peoples that have similar names?<br><br>Many individuals in Genesis eventually had large numbers of descendants who were called after their ancestor\\u2019s name. For example, Cush was the name of an individual. But, \\u201CCush\\u201D also became the name of nation that his descendants formed. They were called \\u201CCushites.\\u201D If possible, when translating these names, the translator should make the individual\\u2019s name and the nation\\u2019s name similar. Examples of this are \\u201CCush\\u201D and \\u201CCushite\\u201D or \\u201CMoab\\u201D and \\u201CMoabite.\\u201D Otherwise, the translator may say, \\u201Cthe descendants of Cush\\u201D or \\u201Cthe descendants of Moab.\\u201D<br><br>### What do the phrases \\u201Cto this day\\u201D or \\u201Cof today\\u201D mean?<br><br>These phrases were used by the narrator to refer to the time when he was writing. The translator should be aware that \\u201Cto this day\\u201D and \\u201Cof today\\u201D refer to a time already passed. The translator might decide to say, \\u201Cto this day, at the time when this is being written,\\u201D or, \\u201Cto this day, at the time of writing.\\u201D This Hebrew phrase occurs in Gen. 19:37, 19:38, 22:14, 26:33, 32:32, 35:20, 47:26, 48:18.\";\\nconst lineA2 = \"1:intro\\\\tzb6f\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t0\\\\t# Genesis 01 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This chapter presents the first account of God creating the world. There is a pattern to this account: \\u201CGod said\\u2026God saw that it was good\\u2026This was evening and morning, the first day.\\u201D Translators should preserve this pattern in their versions.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The universe<br><br>This account of creation is told within the framework of ancient Hebrew ideas about the universe: the earth was resting with water around it and below it. Over the earth was something like a vast dome, called \\u201Can expanse between the waters\\u201D (1:6), on top of which was more water. Translators should try to keep these original images in their work, even though readers in their project language might have a completely different idea of what the universe is like.<br><br>### Evening and morning<br><br>Genesis 1 presents the ancient Hebrew idea of a day: it begins with sunset, lasts through the night and continues through the daylight hours until the next sunset. This pattern should be preserved in translation, even if readers in the project language define \\u201Cday\\u201D differently.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### \\u201CIn the beginning\\u201D<br><br>Some languages and cultures speak of the world as if it has always existed, as if it had no beginning. But \\u201Cvery long ago\\u201D is different from \\u201Cin the beginning,\\u201D and you need to be sure that your translation communicates correctly.<br><br>### \\u201CGod said, \\u2018Let there be\\u2019\\u201D<br><br>This expression occurs often in this chapter. It can be difficult to translate, because God is not shown as talking to a particular person. If God is talking to a thing, it is something not yet in existence. Translators should find the most natural way in the project language to signal the idea that God spoke things into existence; he created the world and the things in it by simply commanding that they should exist.\\n1:1\\\\tf2mg\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t0\\\\t\\\\tIn the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth \\u201CThis is about how God made the heavens and the earth in the beginning.\\u201D This statement summarizes the rest of the chapter. Some languages translate it as \\u201CA very long time ago God created the heavens and the earth.\\u201D Translate it in a way that shows this actually happened and is not just a folk story.\\n1:3\\\\td7qw\\\\t\\\\tfigs-imperative\\\\t\\\\t0\\\\tLet there be light\\\\tThis is a command. By commanding that light should exist, God made it exist. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])\\n1:5\\\\tjc2d\\\\t\\\\tfigs-merism\\\\t\\\\t0\\\\tThis refers to the whole day. The writer speaks of the whole day as if it were these two parts. In the Jewish culture, a day begins when the sun sets. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])\\n1:6\\\\turb3\\\\t\\\\tfigs-imperative\\\\t\\\\t0\\\\tThese are commands. By commanding that the expanse should exist and that it divide the waters, God made it exist and divide the waters. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])\\n1:8\\\\tss9r\\\\t\\\\tfigs-merism\\\\t\\\\t0\\\\tThis refers to the whole day. The writer speaks of the whole day as if it were these two parts. In the Jewish culture, a day begins when the sun sets. See how you translated this in [Genesis 1:5](../01/05.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])\\n1:9\\\\tzu6f\\\\t\\\\tfigs-activepassive\\\\t\\\\t0\\\\tThis can be translated with an active verb. This is a command. By commanding that the waters gather together, God made them gather together. Alternate translation: \\u201CLet the waters\\u2026gather\\u201D or \\u201CLet the waters\\u2026come together\\u201D (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])\";\\nconst lineA9 = \"1:9\\\\tha33\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t0\\\\t\\u201CIt happened like that\\u201D or \\u201CThat is what happened.\\u201D What God commanded happened just as he said it should.

Using the priorities, it processes the notices into a list of warnings that can be displayed with the priority indicated by the colour/redness of the message.\\n\\nIt should be noted that although the success messages are simple strings, the notices and the returned warning lists are lists/arrays of ARRAYS. This is done to allow the encapsulating software to have more flexibility in how the information is used. See the code documentation for the final details, but in general, the error and warning lists contain eight fields:\\n\\n1.  A priority integer (0..999)\\n2.  The book identifier (if relevant, 3-character UPPERCASE string or empty string)\\n3.  The chapter number (if relevant, string or empty string)\\n4.  The verse number (if relevant, string or empty string, can be a range, e.g., \\'22-24\\')\\n5.  The main error/warning message (string)\\n6.  The (zero-based) index of where the error was found on the line. -1 indicates that this field is not helpful/relevant.\\n7.  A text excerpt (typically 10 characters) centred about the error. An empty string indicates that this field is not helpful/relevant.\\n8.  The location of the error, e.g., \"line 2 in file GEN.usfm in unfoldingWord/en_ult repo\".\\n\\nNote below that the optional `processOptions` object allows the user to adjust things like the division point between error and warning priorities, and allows low priority or certain notices to simply be dropped, etc. The system defaults to suppressing multiple cases of similar errors, but this can also be fine-tuned through these parameters.\\n\\nAlthough this demonstration here formats and colour the warning list, it\\u2019s expected that the encapsulating program will format and use the fields as desired. Because they are returned as an array of fields rather than simply strings, it\\u2019s certainly possible for the encapsulating program to sort or filter the messages as desired.'\n    },\n    {\n        'type': 'code',\n        'content': '// The code in this box is editable for changing settings\\u2014\\n//        Simply click inside here and add, change, or delete text as required.\\n\\nimport { checkTextField } from \\'../core/field-text-check\\';\\nimport { processNoticesToSingleList } from \\'./notice-processing-functions\\';\\nimport { RenderRawResults, RenderObject, RenderSuccessesWarningsGradient } from \\'../demos/RenderProcessedResults\\';\\n\\n// Empty, space, good, and bad, link, and RC text samples\\nconst textE = \"\";\\nconst textS = \" \";\\nconst textG = \"Peace on Earth, good will to all men/people!\";\\nconst textB = \" Peace  on\\xA0Earth,, good will to all) men!\\u202F\";\\nconst textL = \"https://unfoldingWord.org\";\\nconst textRC1 = \"rc://en/obs/book/obs/02/03\";\\nconst textRC2 = \"Compare with rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/canaan\";\\n\\n// Just change this next two lines to change the text being used (to demonstrate differing results)\\nconst chosenTextName = \"textB\";\\nconst chosenText = textB;\\n\\n// The third parameter is \"linksAllowed\"\\nconst rawResults = checkTextField(\\'en\\', \\'TN\\', \\'raw\\', \\'Sample\\', chosenText, false, \\'in \\'+chosenTextName+\\' that was supplied\\');\\nif (!rawResults.successList || !rawResults.successList.length)\\n    rawResults.successList = [\"Done basic text checks\"];\\nconst processOptions = {\\n    // Uncomment any of these to test them\\n    // \\'maximumSimilarMessages\\': 3, // default is 2\\n    // \\'cutoffPriorityLevel\\': 200, // default is 0\\n    // \\'sortBy\\': \\'ByRepo\\', // default is \\'ByPriority\\', also have \\'AsFound\\'\\n    // \\'ignorePriorityNumberList\\': [123, 202], // default is []\\n};\\nconst processedResults = processNoticesToSingleList(rawResults, processOptions);\\n\\n<>\\n<b>Check</b> \"{chosenText}\"<br/><br/>\\n<RenderRawResults results={rawResults} />\\n<br/>Which after processing{Object.keys(processOptions).length? <> using <b>processOptions</b><RenderObject thisObject={processOptions} /></>:\\'\\'} then becomes:<br/><br/>\\n<RenderSuccessesWarningsGradient results={processedResults} />\\n</>',\n        'settings': {},\n        'evalInContext': evalInContext\n    }\n]\n\t\n\n//# sourceURL=webpack:///./src/demos/notice-processing3.md?./node_modules/react-styleguidist/lib/loaders/examples-loader.js");
