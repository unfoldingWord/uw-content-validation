## Plain Text Check Sandbox

This function checks the given text for typical formatting errors.

It returns a list of success messages and a list of notice components. (There is always a priority number in the range 0..999 and the main message string, as well as other details to help locate the error as available.)

These raw notice components can then be filtered and/or sorted as required by the calling program, and then divided into a list of errors and a list of warnings or whatever as desired.

```js
// The control code in this box is editable for changing settingsâ€”
//    simply click inside here and add, change, or delete text as required.
// Note that (gray) lines starting with // are "comments", i.e., they are ignored by the software
//    so if you want to enable those lines, you must remove the // from the beginning of the line.
